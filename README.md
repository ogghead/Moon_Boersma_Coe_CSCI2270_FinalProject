# Moon_Boersma_Coe_CSCI2270_FinalProject

PHASE ONE
On this team there is Richard Moon, Darwin Boersma, and Alex Coe, and we are making a BlackJack game.
BlackJack consists of multiple 52-card decks that are ultmately used to play against the dealer.
The player will be able to choose the number of decks and the number of AI players at the table. 
The goal of the game is to recieve a higher score than the dealer but without going over 21. 
During the player's turn, our program will require input from the user to choose 
to either hit, stand, double down, or split. In our code we will use stacks to implement the decks used in the game. 
Hit, stand, double down, and split will be executed through various branches of functions, but we will also have to 
simultaneously compare the user's hand to the dealer's hand in order to declare a winner. 

PHASE TWO
As stated above, this team consists of Richard Moon, Darwin Boersma, and Alex Coe, and we created the game of BlackJack. 
There are a total of 19 unique functions that contribute to the functionality of our project. This includes a function
to build the deck, shuffle the deck, and create the players, just to name a few. Just like any standard game of BlackJack,
the player is given the option to either hit, stand, split, or double-down during their turn. The ultimate goal of the game
is to recieve a higher score than the dealer while staying under 21. Any Jacks, Kings, or Queens are counted as a value
of 10. 
In order to run our program, refer to main.cpp, BlackJack.cpp, and BlackJack.h in this repository. Download a zip of these files 
in the Virtual Machine and use command line to locate it (use cd <filename> to enter a directory, use cd.. to go back a
directory). Once in the directory, including main.cpp, Blackjack.cpp, and Blackjack.h, type 'make' in the command line to get the
files to compile, then type './a.out' to run the program. An alternative option to run our program is to use CodeBlocks 
by creating a new project and class, along with referring to the three files mentioned above by copying them to their 
respective files. Make sure you are using C++11.
As for system requirements, use the Virtual Machine. 
There was one small contributor to our project---Darwin's dad. He answered any questions we had regarding gitHub.
In order to avoid any open issues/bugs, just make sure that you type what the question is asking for (ie. don't type a 
letter when asked for a number).
