# Moon_Boersma_Coe_CSCI2270_FinalProject

This is the README.
On this team there is a Richard Moon, a Darwin Boersma, and a Alex Coe, and we are making a BlackJack game.
The player is able to choose the number of decks, and the number of AI players at the table. The player
will be able to hit, stand, double down, split, and take insurance.
