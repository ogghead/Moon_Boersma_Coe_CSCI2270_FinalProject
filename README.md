# Moon_Boersma_Coe_CSCI2270_FinalProject

This is the README.
On this team there is Richard Moon, Darwin Boersma, and Alex Coe, and we are making a BlackJack game.
BlackJack consists of multiple 52-card decks that are ultmately used to play against the dealer.
The player will be able to choose the number of decks and the number of AI players at the table. 
The goal of the game is to recieve a higher score than the dealer but without going over 21. 
During the player's turn, our program will require input from the user to choose 
to either hit, stand, double down, or split. In our code we will use stacks to implement the decks used in the game. 
Hit, stand, double down, and split will be executed through various branches of functions, but we will also have to 
simultaneously compare the user's hand to the dealer's hand in order to declare a winner.
